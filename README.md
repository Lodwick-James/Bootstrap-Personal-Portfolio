* I wanted to create a simple portfolio with reusable code, so I utilized Bootstrap, 
* a free and open-source CSS framework aimed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.
* It includes design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components 
* in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
